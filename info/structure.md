# Draft of Structure

Here is a draft of our project structure, possibly revised for better design

- Datamazing
    - src
        - sql
            - tables
            Table creation may need to be done in advance of running database application functions
            
            The following functions may need to be implemented in python, via variables. 
            - queries
            - deletions
            - insertions
        - cli
            - main for prompt user's input (interface)

    - info
        - todo.md
        - structure.md
